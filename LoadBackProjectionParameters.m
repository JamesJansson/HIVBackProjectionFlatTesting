% Lang et al 1989 Patterns of T Lymphocyte Changes with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection: From Seroconversion to the Development of AIDS
% This study closely followed the trajectories of PLHIV in the early stages
% of disease, and reports a median CD4 at a fixed time (6 months). As far
% as reliability goes this estimate is this best, as it is straight data 
% (not modelled). In this study CD4 is 636 at 12 months in seroconverters 
% (of 37 seroconverters), which is when CD4 counts stabilise and resemble 
% CD4 count decline of the seroprevalent population. This figure agrees with: 
% * Seroconverter CD4 intercepts in Lodi 2010 (624.1) 
% * MSM <40 years CD4 intercepts (621 (609-634) or 631 (619-643)) in Cascade 2003 Differences in CD4 Cell Counts at Seroconversion and Decline Among 5739 HIV-1 Infected Individuals with Well-Estimated Dates of Seroconversion

% However, Kaufmann et al. (a study that closely follows the CD4 counts of 
% seroconverters) states that the average highest point following infection is
% 756. This result has sampling bias, as CD4 counts vary and choosing the
% highest over a period will be higher than the expected mean at a set time
% (e.g. at 3 months exactly). This hypothesis is supported by the result 
% for median CD4 count at 12 months which is reported as 470 cells/microL.

% The 2012 surveillance data of Australian recent infections (0-12 months) had a mean 
% CD4 of 576.0619, which is somewhat lower, although once again this has 
% sampling bias as this may include people in acute infection which we 
% would expect to be lower than rebound CD4 levels. It also includes people
% who would be  p to 12 months past their primary infection 
% who we may expect to be about 60-80 cells lower than the people who have 
% had their CD4 rebound following primary infection. 
% Assuming a square root decline over 12 months of 1.6 (see below), and an 
% equal distribution of testing over those 12 months, CD4=576 (sqrCD4=24) 
% should, on average, occur at 6 months, meaning the starting sqrCD4 is
% approximately 24+1.6/2=24.8, which gives a starting CD4 of 615. 
% The Australian data observations are in agreement with the simulated intercept of Lodi 2011

%% Square root decline model 
% The weighted mean of the decline is 61 cells per year 
% assuming a  mean of 400 cells in the study, and a loss of 61 cells in the
% year following, meaning a fall to 339. The square root of these values
% are 20.00 and 18.41 respectively. This represents an annual decline in
% square root CD4 counts of 1.588 per year.

% This result is in alignment with the result from Cascade 2003 Differences in CD4 Cell Counts at Seroconversion and Decline Among 5739 HIV-1–Infected Individuals with Well-Estimated Dates of Seroconversion
% This paper showed a square root decline between 1.22 and 1.67
% depending on age and whether the result was adjusted for drop outs. 

% Note that the result above is not exactly in alignment with two studies by Lodi et al. 
% Firstly, Lodi 2010 found that in the seroconverter group, decline was
% 1.758 per year in the baseline group (<30 years, MSM) and up to 1.908 in 
% men older than 30 years. Alternately, Lodi 2011 found square root decline
% to be 1.159 per year, a highly divergent result to the 2010 resuilts.

% It should be noted that both of these model parameter results are 
% multi-parameter models. Lodi 2010 had a high starting CD4 and a fast CD4
% decline, while Lodi 2011 had a low starting CD4 and a slow CD4 decline,
% implying that the fitting function was converging to similar times and
% more observations in the centre of observations (after ~ second and thrid
% year) and hence the suitability for describing the early stage decline
% and the CD4 count immediately following infection may be limited.
