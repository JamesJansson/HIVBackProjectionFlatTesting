BackProjection
==============

This codes allows estimates to be calculated of the time between infection and diagnosis for a group of individuals based on the CD4 at diagnosis. 

Probably the best way to get started is to use the "ExampleSimulation.m" file. Simply run this file, and an example data set of CD4 counts at diagnosis is loaded into the CD4 backprojection routine.
